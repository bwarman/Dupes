#Dupes Script
A simple After Effects Expression to duplicate layers and offset their position, scale and rotation. Offers the option to parent to the duplicated layer or just duplicate.

##How to Use
Install the script in your ScriptsUI folder. When open, select a layer or layers and tell Dupes how many copies (duplicates) you want of the layer/layers. You can enter in your desired position, rotation, and scale transformations for each duplicate (additive) and then duplicate the layers. Duplicated layers can also be parented to the primary duplicated layer, or be duplicated to an average position null.
